## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.





##Introduction - Emily  


Data examined, details of dataset-- why chosen? prior research?  


## SMART questions -- Emily  
Are there statistically measurable changes in weather patterns (e.g., temperature and precipitation levels) over time in New York City?
Do temperature trends in New York City align with the documented rise in average global temperatures over the last century?
Are there any notable (and statistically significant) changes in weather patterns after/during the pandemic lockdown (perhaps due to changes in commuting patterns)?


## Temperature - stat tests of temp trends over time  

## Chris's linear model  - blurb  

## Emily's linear model  

## Central Park v. Global average - Chris  

## JFK data, comparable?  - Emily  

How did thinking change? reframing of questioning?  
Additional data to test our hypothesis of causality  

## Precipitation trends -Tejas' outlier analysis + snowfall at Christmas

## Linear models of precipitation trends over time - Chris

## Correlation between temp / precip -- Emily  ... think about subsequent analyses

## Lockdown - Chris

## Conclusion- terse summary of findings, restate new questions from all sections, ideas for future analyses if you give us more money.    

If we have time, summarize what we learned from each variable, and new questions?
