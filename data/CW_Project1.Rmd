## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Importing Weather Data
```{r }

weather_data <- data.frame(read.csv("NYC_weather_1869_2022.csv"))

#head(weather_data, 5)

```

## Separating Date into Day/Mont/Year columns

```{r}

weather_data$DATE <- as.Date(weather_data$DATE)

weather_data$YEAR <- format(weather_data$DATE, "%Y")
weather_data$MONTH<- format(weather_data$DATE, "%m")
weather_data$DAY <- format(weather_data$DATE, "%d")

#head(weather_data, 5)

```



## Subsetting Data and Finding Monthly Averages for Temp, Precip, and Snowfall

``` {r}

weather_100yr <- subset(weather_data, weather_data$YEAR > 1899)

month_tmax_avg <- aggregate(TMAX ~ MONTH + YEAR, weather_100yr, mean)
month_tmin_avg <- aggregate(TMIN ~ MONTH + YEAR, weather_100yr, mean)
month_precip_avg <- aggregate(PRCP ~ MONTH + YEAR, weather_100yr, mean)
month_snow_avg <- aggregate(SNOW ~ MONTH + YEAR, weather_100yr, mean)
#month_tmax_avg$date <- paste("01",month_avg$MONTH, month_avg$YEAR, sep = "/")
#month_tmax_avg$date <- as.Date(month_avg$date,"%d/%m/%Y")

month_avg <- data.frame(month_tmax_avg, month_tmin_avg$TMIN,
                        month_precip_avg$PRCP, month_snow_avg$SNOW)
colnames(month_avg)[4:6] <- c("TMIN", "PRCP", "SNOW")

```


## Plotting the Data
```{r}

seasonal_tmax <- subset(month_avg, MONTH == "03" |
                          MONTH == "06" | 
                          MONTH == "09" | 
                          MONTH == "12")

library(ggplot2)
tmax_scatter <- ggplot(seasonal_tmax, aes(x = YEAR, y = TMAX, col = MONTH)) +
 geom_point()
tmax_scatter

```

## Question 1:
Are there statistically measurable changes in weather patterns (e.g., temperature and precipitation levels) over time in New York City over this window?

- Separate into seasons
- Compare seasonal temps from early 1900 to recent temps?
- What statistical test?
- Does this require a linear model?
```{r}
june_tmax <- subset(month_avg, MONTH == "06")
lm(formula = TMAX ~ YEAR, data = june_tmax)

```


## Question 2:
Are there any notable (and statistically significant) changes in weather patterns after/during the pandemic lockdown (perhaps due to changes in commuting patterns)?

- Compare 10 years prior to 2020 to 2 years after?
- Chi-square test or 2-sample t-test?




## Question 3:
Do the observed changes in the weather data from New York City align with the documented rise in global air temperatures over the last century?

- Compare rate of change observed in NYC to the global rate
- What stat test? 
- Earth’s temperature has risen by 0.14° Fahrenheit (0.08° Celsius) per decade since 1880, but the rate of warming since 1981 is more than twice that: 0.32° F (0.18° C) per decade. (per climate.gov)
