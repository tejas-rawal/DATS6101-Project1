# Data Descriptions

**DC_weather_2020-2022.csv </br>**
Contains a variety of weather observations for the DC area-- looks to actually be from weather stations in MD. Many of the values are NA! </br>
Here is the site where I found weather data: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/ </br>
It seems to have additional data, for free download. It suggests records go back to the 1800s, but I'd guess most of the parameters' observations are NA. </br>



**Bee Dataset**
Geo-located occurrences of wild bees (superfamily Apoidea, clade Anthophila) in Maryland, Delaware, and Washington DC USA collected between 2002 and 2016 by the Native Bee Inventory and Monitoring Lab, United State Geological Survey. Data set is too large to upload to git, the download link here: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Mid-Atlantic_USA_wild_bee_occurrences_all_records/10266458.

Thought we could potentially pair it with another dataset for interesting correlations.
