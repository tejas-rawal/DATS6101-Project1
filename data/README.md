DC_weather_2020-2022.csv 
Contains a variety of weather data for the DC area-- looks to actually be from weather stations in MD.

Here is the site where I found weather data: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/
It seems to have additional data, for free download. It suggests records go back t the 1800s, but I'd guess most of the parameters' observations are NA.
