**DC_weather_2020-2022.csv </br>**
Contains a variety of weather observations for the DC area-- looks to actually be from weather stations in MD. Many of the values are NA! </br>
Here is the site where I found weather data: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/ </br>
It seems to have additional data, for free download. It suggests records go back to the 1800s, but I'd guess most of the parameters' observations are NA. </br>
