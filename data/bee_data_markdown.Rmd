## Bee Data

I thought it could be interesting to look at local bee populations and potentially pair it with some other local data like weather. I ended up digging through a lot of random insect databases and ended up finding a database from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00577-0.

I was able to download the author's dataset from: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Mid-Atlantic_USA_wild_bee_occurrences_all_records/10266458



```{r }

bee_data <- data.frame(read.csv("1OccurrenceLevel_AllBees.csv"))

```


The dataset is pretty big, it contains `r nrow(bee_data)` rows and `r ncol(bee_data)` columns.

Full dataset structure below:

```{r}
str(bee_data)

```
