# DATS6101-Project1
Intro To Data Science EDA Project

This readme file is for planning about the project.

We will draft out proposal here.

The Data folder will hold potential data sets; its readme file will hold short descriptions of datasets.

We will upload our rmd files with EDA (if done) on these data sets.

By Thursday, 9/29, we will arrive at strong candidates for our dataset.

At our Saturday 10/1 meeting, we will decide on the dataset and preliminary question/s to include in the proposal (due 10/6).
